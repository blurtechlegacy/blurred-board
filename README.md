## Getting started

## Useful features

- All paths in the project are relative ([`src/classes/utils/Logger`](src/classes/utils/Logger.ts), [`src/components/App`](src/components/App.tsx) and etc).
- Prettier. Formats your code according to the rules in [`.prettierc`](.prettierrc). In WebStorm keyboard shortcut `Alt+Shift+Ctrl+P`.
